# lightbox -- A Simple Puzzle Game

Rules copied from [Black Box from Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/doc/blackbox.html#blackbox). 
[Simon Tatham's online implementation.](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/blackbox.html)
This implementation was created independently from the same set of rules - I haven't seen Simon Tatham's source code. 
As such, this is not intended as a port to rust -- simply a fun programming exercise I undertook to recreate a puzzle game I enjoyed. 


 ## Quickstart

(assuming you have a working rust toolchain installed)

 1. Clone this repo. 
 2. Build the executable.  
    `cargo build --release`
 3. Run the executable and play!  
    `cargo run -- 10`  
    binary file location: `target/release/lightbox`  
    `./lightbox --help` to see the full usage instructions
